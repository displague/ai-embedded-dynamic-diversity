# Research Backlog

1. Add policy-level objective heads for explicit downstream tasks.
2. Add true multi-agent competition inside the same world instance.
3. Implement quantization-aware training and ONNX Runtime benchmark on Raspberry Pi 5.
4. Replace UDP test bridge with hardware bus adapters (I2C/SPI/CAN/UART).
5. Add checkpoint comparison dashboards across multiple embodiments.
6. Tune curriculum schedules specifically against hardy-line profiles (`storm`, `blackout`, `crosswind`).
7. Add car-focused robustness objectives and weighting to reduce persistent high mismatch under hardy profiles.
